# Book Finder

## Project Description

Book Finder is a client-side web application that allows users to search for books by title or author using the Open Library REST API. It can be accessed through the Vercel link in the "About" section. The application displays a list of results and provides additional details for each book on demand. It also allows users to bookmark their favorite books, which are saved in local storage and displayed on the homepage. The site includes data visualization using Chart.js to display the most frequent authors in a user's search results.

## Target Browsers

Book Finder is built to be compatible with all modern desktop browsers!
